# Linux Lessons<br/>
## Task 1:<br/>
### Part1
   - Login to system as root **sudo su**;
   - Change password **passwd** yuo must be **SU** take constrution **passwd username**;
   - Determine users **whoiam, who, w**;
   - Linux **HELP** system **man** use to take manual **man** _programname_.<br/>
   
   
### Part2
   - **tree** _command_ printed files in tree visualization;
   - **file** _command_ with different keys use to determine type of file;
   - **cd~/** comeback from any directory to **/home/**
   

## Task 2 :<br/>
 1. If use **cat/etc/passwd** command show information about all users registred in filesystem.<br/>
-  If use **cat/etc/group** command show information about all groupsregistred in filesystem.<br/>
-  **pseudo-users** Users of these names are not registered in the system and are only needed to confirm ownership of the processes. It has, **id** from **1** to **499** sometime **999** <br/>

2. **UID - User identifier** values in the range 0 to 99 should be **statically allocated** by the system, and shall not be created by applications, while **UIDs** from **100 to 499** should be **reserved** for dynamic allocation by system administrators and post install scripts.  <br/>
 To find **UID** use the command **id** **cat/etc/passwd** 
3. **GID - group identifier** To find **GID** use the command **id** **cat/etc/passwd**
4. To determine belonging of user to the specific group need to use the _command_ **groups username**
5. **useradd** are the command for adding a user to the system. <b/>
Basic parameters required to create a user are **username, password, /home/ shell** <b/>
6. To change the name (account name) of an existing user use the _command_ **sudo usermod -l new_username old_username**

7. The **skel_dir** is **template** for a **home** directory of _new user_.
8. To **remove** a user from the system (including his mailbox) use **userdel [-r] username**
9. The _commands_ and _keys_ should be used to lock and unlock a user account is **usermod -f** **usermod -e**
10. To remove a user's password and provide him with a password-free login for subsequent password use the _command_ **passwd -e username**
11. To display the extended format of information about the directoryuse the _command_ **ls -l**
12. The access rights exist at _file_ or _directory_ has tree parameers **owner, group, others**
13. The sequence of defining the relationship between the file and the user is **owner**
14. The _command_ are used to change the owner of a file (directory), is **chown ugo+-rwx, or numeric**
15. An example of octal representation of access rights is numeric **chmod 777** all rights are aprouwed for all ugo
16. **Sticky Bit** is mainly used on folders in order to avoid deletion of a folder and itâ€™s content by other users though they having write permissions on the folder contents.
17. The file attributes should be present in the command script looks like combination rwxrwxrwx
